# Resume Classification using Machine Learning and NLP

## Overview

This project is an intelligent Resume Classification system that automatically categorizes resumes into relevant job roles using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP). The system helps automate resume screening, reducing manual effort and improving recruitment efficiency.

It includes a trained machine learning model and an interactive web application built with Streamlit for real-time resume classification.
